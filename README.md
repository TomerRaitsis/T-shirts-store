# T-shirts store design

This small project is a design for a t-shirt online store.
I did this design while learning HTML5 and CSS3 and I also chose to use Bootstrap5 to practice something I never used before.
Both the HTML5 and CSS3 are in the same HTML file, I did not use the Bootstrap5 locally so there is a link inside the 'head' tag.
